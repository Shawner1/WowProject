BizWiz
======
No more minding your own business! Welcome to the BizWiz app, giving you the ability to ask and/or answer questions about any small business related topic as a business owner. It's features are aligned with a typical CRUD app. The home page has the name of the industry that the Q&As are relevant to. When clicking the industry you have the ability to see all the questions and answers given so far, with the option to ask a question or give an answer on that page. The questions and answers submitted will enter the database and be on display after submissions. If you click on a question or answer that is already there, you are taken to a page for that specific question or answer, with the ability to comment on it or see other comments on that question. Now, let's get down to business! Follow these simple steps to use our app:
